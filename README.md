# build_chatbot

Building a complete chatbot is a complex task that requires Natural Language Processing (NLP) and possibly machine learning techniques. A simple Python program for a chatbot can be created using a rule-based approach with a fixed set of responses to predefined questions.

Sure! Below is a README file template for your Python program building a basic rule-based chatbot:

# Chatbot in Python

## Introduction
Welcome to the Chatbot Python program! This program creates a simple rule-based chatbot that responds to predefined user inputs. The chatbot uses a set of rules to determine the appropriate response to user queries.

## Requirements
This program requires Python 3.x to run.

## How to Run the Chatbot
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory containing the Python script (`chatbot.py`).
3. Run the `chatbot.py` script using the following command:
   ```
   python chatbot.py
   ```
4. The chatbot will start and prompt you to enter your queries.
5. Type "Goodbye" to exit the chatbot.

## Program Description
The Chatbot program uses a rule-based approach to handle user input. The `get_response` function takes the user's input, converts it to lowercase, and checks for predefined keywords to respond accordingly.

## Customization
- To add more predefined responses, you can extend the `get_response` function with additional rules based on the user's input.
- For a more advanced chatbot, consider using NLP libraries like spaCy or NLTK, or explore machine learning-based chatbot frameworks like Rasa, ChatterBot, or Dialogflow.
